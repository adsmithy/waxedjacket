    <h2><em>"A Flint and Tinder Flannel-Lined Waxed Trucker Jacket Review"</em></h2>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p class="words">There are plenty of jackets out there, but if you’re looking for one that does it all—something rugged, stylish, and built to last—you can’t beat a waxed canvas jacket. It’s the kind of jacket that feels just as at home on a weekend hike as it does grabbing a drink downtown during happy hour. Durable, weather-resistant, and effortlessly cool, it’s the perfect mix of function and style.</p>
    <p class="words">What makes it so versatile? For starters, waxed canvas is water-resistant but still breathable. Unlike synthetic rain jackets that can feel stuffy, this one keeps you dry without trapping heat, making it comfortable to wear year-round. And speaking of durability, waxed canvas is tough—really tough. Originally designed for sailors and workers who needed gear that could take a beating, this fabric only gets better with age, developing a patina unique to you.</p>

    <p class="words">But it’s not just about performance—it’s about adaptability. A waxed canvas jacket works in almost any setting. Layer it over a T-shirt on crisp fall days, throw on a flannel underneath in winter, or wear it over a sweater when the temperature really drops. The wind-resistant fabric keeps you warm without adding bulk, and the classic design ensures you always look put together.</p>
    <p class="words">The best part? This is a jacket that sticks with you for life. Unlike trendy outerwear that wears out or goes out of style, a waxed canvas jacket can be rewaxed and maintained for decades. It’s an investment, but one that pays off every time you throw it on and head out the door.</p>
    <p class="words">If you’re only going to own one truly dependable jacket, make it a waxed canvas jacket—because nothing else compares. Based on my own personal experience, I highly recommend the <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100liveN/pubref:WaxedTruckerJacket/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fhuckberry.com%2Fstore%2Fflint-and-tinder%2Fcategory%2Fp%2F55166-flannel-lined-waxed-trucker-jacket">Flint and Tinder Flannel-Lined Waxed Trucker Jacket</a>.</p>

    <h2>The Jacket</h2>
    <p>I've owned this jacket for six years, and i've put it through the paces. When I first received it, it sat dormant in my closet for 15 months due to a warm spell here in Tennessee. Temperatures ranged between 75 and 90 degrees fahrenheit for nearly a year. Fast forward to 2020 and I was wearing this jacket every day in the rain, the snow, and out in the yard while working on various DIY and home maintenance projects. Needless to say, the Flint and Tinder Flannel-Lined Waxed Canvas Trucker Jacket only gets better with use.</p>

    <h2>How I've Used It</h2>
    <p>I've mowed grass in it, tackled yard work and gardening in the early spring, and sat in a chair in a misty rainstorm at my daughter's cross-country meet. It always gets the job done. My most memorable experience working in this jacket is trimming a tree with a chainsaw atop of a 50-foot boom lift in May of 2023, and loading the trimmed pieces of said tree in my pickup truck. Other tasks include running currogated pipe from my gutters into the woods during a heavy downpour of rain (something all too common here in Tennessee, unfortunately) without the rain ever having made it's way though the waxed canvas material. Man I love waxed canvas. The good kind anyway.</p>
    <p>And while i sold off my motorcycle years ago, i'd be willing to bet that the Flint and Tinder Flannel-Lined Waxed Trucker Jacket makes for a better riding jacket than a leather jacket due to playing better with precipitation, and how much easier it is on your wallet.</p>

    <h2>Sizing</h2>
    <p>I'm six feet tall and 215 pounds with a 34 inch waist and 45-inch chest. I guess you could say i'm an athletic build, built much like a smaller NFL running back without the athletic ability, of course. For slim-fit jackets, i typically wear an extra-large, and a large for regular fit jackets. The Flint and Tinder Flannel-Lined Waxed Canvas Jacket I own is an extra-large. It wears a tad large, and I think a Large size would've fit better with a t-shirt underneath. For layering a sweatshirt underneath in colder weather, however, the size is perfect. Keep in mind that the jacket's canvas construction will definitely stretch out a bit over time and wear, so size accordingly.</p>
    <h2>Quality</h2>
    <p>This waxed jacket is heavy duty. Thorn bushes and brushes across asphalt be damned. You can't hurt it, only help it become better, no matter how much you abuse it, which is the exact reason I created a single page website just to talk about this jacket. The more you sweat into it, bleed into it, and subject it to the elements, the softer it will become and the more it will fit your body like it was tailor-made for you. The hardware is beefy as well. The custom metal buttons sporting an antique finish make for a nice touch.</p>
    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Made in the USA</li>
      <li>Weather-resistant waxed Martexin sailcloth construction</li>
      <li>A re-waxable exterior for a lifetime of water-resistance</li>
      <li>Fully-lined with a soft blanket lining</li>
      <li>Interior phone pocket</li>
      <li>This is the jacket that Pedro Pascal's character wears in HBO’s The Last of Us</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Are there other worthy waxed jackets on the market? Yes. Some of them, like the Line Of Trade Waxed Ranch Jacket, are less expensive and also worth the price, but sometimes you get what you pay for. And Flint and Tinder's Flannel-Lined Waxed Trucker Jacket is one of those times. If you're willing to spend $150, you might as well spend $298 for a jacket that'll last you for the rest of your life, and the rest of the life of the person you hand it down to after you're gone.</p>
